For information about how the deployed and customized VFX burst rendering environment on the AWS Cloud should be implemented to meet ISE best practices and recommended security controls, see the [security controls mapping document](assets/ISE Compliant VFX Burst Rendering on AWS - Security Control Mapping.docx). This mapping provides your VFX studio with the guidance needed to demonstrate, document, and prepare the VFX burst rendering environment for an ISE security audit.
